## ðŸ“˜ Project: Bioreactor Simulation (Chemostat Model)

This Jupyter Notebook contains a simulation-based project completed as part of my master's degree coursework in Quantitative Biology.

### ðŸ§ª Features:
- Implements Monod kinetics in a continuous bioreactor (chemostat)
- Simulates biomass and substrate dynamics
- Includes steady-state analysis and sensitivity plots
- Uses Python libraries: NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective:
To explore how process parameters affect biomass productivity and apply basic optimization logic relevant to process engineering.
